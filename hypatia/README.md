Some colab notebooks don't render because of widgets that don't render on github.  So some of these links are google drive:

* [Download Daily Data and Saved in MongoDB](https://github.com/werowe/deepstate-map-data/blob/main/hypatia/download_deepstate.py)
* [Battlefield Gains Calculation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18kgujrucq1jifVEmb1g5ikOtS0ElFqgp?usp=sharing)
* [Time Series:  Changed in Occupied and Liberated Territories](https://github.com/werowe/deepstate-map-data/blob/main/hypatia/deepstate-time-series.ipynb)
